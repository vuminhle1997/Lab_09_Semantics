## Requirements

- Python extension and Jupyter extension for VSCode

```bash
# setup venv
python3 -m venv $PWD/venv or
python -m venv $PWD/venv

# activate venv
source ./venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hint

The files "ratings.csv" and "movies_metadata.csv" are too big to upload. In order to run the notebook, these files need to be downloaded from the third source and then should be moved into the "data" directory.
